%
% Uses regression to remove the time course(s) contained in s from the data
% contained in X. s could be the eye movements measured with EOG channels
% and X could be the remaining EEG channels. In this case the EOG signal
% that is contained in X will be removed (as best as possible, assuming a
% stationary eye movement pattern).

% In:
%   X - data matrix of size(X) = [T, n_channels]
%   s - time course of components to be removed, size(s) = [T, n_components]
%       n_components can be more than one
%
% Out:
%   X_new - same as X with the contribution of s removed. size(X_new) =
%           size(X). Note that this method reduces the rank of X_new!
%   A   - pattern matrix of size(A) = [n_channels, n_components], which
%           shows how each of the components in s project to the channels
%           in X.
%   s_hat - the estimate of s, which is extracted from X
